latexWordCount
==============

Count the words in a .tex file. The program will ask for the name of the file, which should be given without the .tex extension (this will ONLY work with .tex files). Spacing in names is allowed.

Windows
==============
For windows users, take the file in the Windows folder, put that file whereever the .tex file is, then run it. Once again, only the file name without the extension should be given.

==============
Most of the credit goes to http://www.reddit.com/user/megasteven. I only made some modifications so that I could use it.
