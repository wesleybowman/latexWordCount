latexWordCount
==============

Count the words in a .tex file. The program will ask for the name of the file, which should be given without the .tex extension (this will ONLY work with .tex files)

Windows
==============
For windows users, take the file in the Windows folder, put that file where ever your .tex file is, then run it.
